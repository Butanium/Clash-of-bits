A codingame multiplayer game project inspired by [gladiabots](https://store.steampowered.com/app/871930/GLADIABOTS__AI_Combat_Arena/)

Due to the fact that someone else got a contribution called "clash of **bots**" approved before me, the name of the game on the codingame website is "clash of **bits** : explode another day"

You can try play online [here](https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6587dcc2e3a07bd4696c16a3e63238b4a184), definitly the best way to play it.

If you want to run it on your local machine,
 - Download on of the release (the latest is the best)
 - Unzip the archive
 - run any of the runner in `src\test\java\Runners` with JDK 1.8 (or higher) and Maven installed (if you use intellij you can have both). After it ran, open ` http://localhost:8888/test.html`  to watch the battle.
